Here are some formatting rules for formulas/equations. Remember to use Typst syntax.

Probabilities—unless explicitly defined as something else—should be upper case $P$ i.e. `$ P("event") = dots $`

Text in formulas/equations should be formatted as text with quotes i.e. `"..."`. If uppercase then it should be formatted as smallcaps.
